# Music-Recommendation-through-Facial-Expression-Recognition
https://music-recommendation-system-e8n2.onrender.com/
Developed a model to detect and classify human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from facial expressions. Used CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for training and OpenCV for real-time face detection. Achieved 98% accuracy in emotion classification. Implemented a live demo where a camera captures and predicts expressions instantly.
